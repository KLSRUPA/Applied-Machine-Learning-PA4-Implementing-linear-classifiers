## PA4 Title: Implementing Linear Classifiers: Support Vector Classification and Logistic Regression

### Description:
In this project, I implemented two key algorithms for training classifiers: Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Logistic Regression (LR). The objectives were to gain practical experience in implementing machine learning algorithms, deepen our understanding of SVC and LR, and familiarize ourselves with the structure of typical academic papers in machine learning. The project involved coding the algorithms in Python, structuring our work in Jupyter Notebooks, and providing comprehensive documentation to ensure clarity and reproducibility. We extended our basic implementations through optional bonus tasks and detailed our findings in a technical report.
